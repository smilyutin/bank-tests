## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Workflow doesn't appear

**Fix:** Push files to GitHub first
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Can't find APP repo

**Fix:** For private repos, add PAT token
1. Create token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Add to secrets: Settings → Secrets → New secret
3. Name: `APP_REPO_TOKEN`
4. Update workflow line 63

### Issue: Health check fails

**Fix:** Check APP logs in artifacts
```
Workflow run → Scroll down → Download "app-logs"
```
