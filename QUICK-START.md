## 🔄 Daily Usage

### Run Tests Manually

**GitHub UI:**
```
1. Go to: github.com/smilyutin/bank-tests/actions
2. Click: "Test Vulnerable Bank Application"
3. Click: "Run workflow"
4. Click: "Run workflow" again
```

**GitHub CLI:**
```bash
gh workflow run test-vuln-bank.yml \
  --repo smilyutin/bank-tests \
  -f app_branch=main \
  -f soft_mode=true \
  -f test_suite=all
```

### Automatic Triggers

Automatic triggers are **disabled by default** in this repo to avoid noisy red runs while the target app is knowingly insecure.

To run tests, use:
- **Manual** GitHub Actions trigger (`workflow_dispatch`), or
- The main workflow: `test-vuln-bank.yml` via manual trigger.

When you’re ready to re-enable automation later, add `push`, `pull_request`, and/or `schedule` triggers back into `.github/workflows/test-vuln-bank.yml`.

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "docker-compose: command not found"

**Status:** ✅ **Already Fixed!**

The workflow now uses Docker Compose V2 syntax (`docker compose` with space).

**Details:** See `FIX-DOCKER-COMPOSE-V2.md`

### Issue: Workflow doesn't appear

**Fix:** Push files to GitHub first
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Can't find APP repo

**Fix:** For private repos, add PAT token
1. Create token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Add to secrets: Settings → Secrets → New secret
3. Name: `APP_REPO_TOKEN`
4. Update workflow line 63

### Issue: Health check fails

**Fix:** Check APP logs in artifacts
```
Workflow run → Scroll down → Download "app-logs"
```
