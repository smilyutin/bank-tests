## 🎯 Next Steps - Commit & Test

### Step 1: Review Changes

```bash
cd /Users/minime/Projects/bank-tests

# See what changed
git status

# Review the workflow fix
git diff .github/workflows/test-vuln-bank.yml
```

### Step 2: Commit Everything

```bash
# Add all files
git add .github/workflows/
git add *.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: Update to Docker Compose V2 syntax

- Replace 'docker-compose' with 'docker compose' (V2)
- Update all workflow steps (start, logs, cleanup)
- Add troubleshooting documentation
- Fixes: command not found error in GitHub Actions"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch It Work!

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   ```
   https://github.com/smilyutin/bank-tests/actions
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - Workflow starts automatically (from the push)
   - Or click "Test Vulnerable Bank Application" → "Run workflow"

3. **Expected Success:**
   ```
   ✅ Clone Test Repo
   ✅ Clone APP Repo  
   ✅ Build APP Docker Image
   ✅ Start APP Container        ← Should work now!
   ✅ Wait for APP to be Ready
   ✅ Run Tests
   ✅ Generate Reports
   ✅ Cleanup
   ```
