## Docker Compose V2 Fix Applied

The workflow has been fixed to use Docker Compose V2 syntax. Here's what was done:

---

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
```
docker-compose: command not found
Error: Process completed with exit code 127
```

### The Solution
Updated all commands from `docker-compose` (V1) to `docker compose` (V2)

### Files Updated
1. `.github/workflows/test-vuln-bank.yml` - Fixed 8 occurrences
2. `PIPELINE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Added troubleshooting section
3. `QUICK-START.md` - Updated references
4. `FIX-DOCKER-COMPOSE-V2.md` - Complete fix documentation

## Next Steps - Commit & Test

### Step 1: Review Changes

```bash
cd /Users/minime/Projects/bank-tests

# See what changed
git status

# Review the workflow fix
git diff .github/workflows/test-vuln-bank.yml
```

### Step 2: Commit Everything

```bash
# Add all files
git add .github/workflows/
git add *.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: Update to Docker Compose V2 syntax

- Replace 'docker-compose' with 'docker compose' (V2)
- Update all workflow steps (start, logs, cleanup)
- Add troubleshooting documentation
- Fixes: command not found error in GitHub Actions"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch It Work!

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   ```
   https://github.com/smilyutin/bank-tests/actions
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - Workflow starts automatically (from the push)
   - Or click "Test Vulnerable Bank Application" → "Run workflow"

3. **Expected Success:**
   ```
   Clone Test Repo
   Clone APP Repo  
   Build APP Docker Image
   Start APP Container        ← Should work now!
   Wait for APP to be Ready
   Run Tests
   Generate Reports
   Cleanup
   ```

## What Changed in Workflow

### Before (Failed)
```yaml
- run: docker-compose up -d          Command not found
- run: docker-compose ps             Command not found
- run: docker-compose logs           Command not found
- run: docker-compose down -v        Command not found
```

### After (Works)
```yaml
- run: docker compose up -d          Docker Compose V2
- run: docker compose ps             Docker Compose V2
- run: docker compose logs           Docker Compose V2
- run: docker compose down -v        Docker Compose V2
```
